1.1.1.	Perform Registration via FSL FLIRT
Registration is performed via FSL’s FLIRT algorithm. The command line below identifies how to perform registration:
~$ kaas_flirt.py -p single_exp -s --progress --asl
NOTE: The “-s” option should only be supplied with the above option or when additional core resources are already active (i.e., in the event of a large number requiring conversion). To skip this, simply do NOT include the “-s” flag. 
NOTE: The kaas_flirt.py program utilizes nipype to execute FLIRT. Input options to the nipype interface are described in the project’s *_flirt_input.json file within the processing_scripts sub-directory in the project’s scratch directory. In addition to the FLIRT input options, this file contains search information for the ASL images (using the key ‘asl_regexstr’), additional inclusion (key ‘inclusionList’) and exclusion (key ‘exclusionList) search characteristics, and an 2-D ASL flag to specify 2D imaging versus 3D (for 2D, set key ‘asl_2d’ as true). The same file is also utilized for other registrations such as structural, fMRI and DTI.
NOTE: This program will search for structural registration output and attempt to concatenate results together to complete ASL to standard registration. The -l | --load flag may be used to synchronize the structural registration data to disk if it is completed but not on the local disk. Providing both --struc and --asl flags enables the simultaneous execution of ASL and structural registration.
