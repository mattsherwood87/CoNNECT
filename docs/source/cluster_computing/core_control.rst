Cores can be controlled via kaas_ec2_control.py, which is described in detail in Section 4.2.2. Cores are internally assigned to specific projects to ensure each project has the appropriate resources and are billed to the appropriate customer/project. A single JSON file identifies the resources for each project. This file is ‘instance_ids.json’ and resides in the scratch directory (/mnt/ss_rhb1/scratch), and is described in detail in Section 5.1.
