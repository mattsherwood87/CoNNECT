The KIDR NPC consists of the following elements:
Master Node: The master is the controller of the cluster. It is a small ec2 instance that is always on and available. The operating system (OS) of the master isUbuntu 18.04. The current IP address for the master is 10.100.30.11.
Core Node(s): Core nodes describe compute nodes of the cluster. The cores can be larger ec2 instances that are not always running but always accessible. To be fiscally efficient, the cores must be started before a large process/job and stopped after the process/job. Currently, the cores also run Ubuntu 18.04; however, they can utilize different OSâ€™s including Windows or Macintosh. The cores must reside in the 10.100.216.* domain. When cores are started (which takes approximately , they will automatically be recognized by the master and jobs can be sent their way. Custom tools have been developed to start and stop these cores. When starting a core, it takes approximately 1-3 minutes for the master to recognize them.
