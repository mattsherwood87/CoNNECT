Jumpbox
=======

The jumpbox is a user-specific virtual machine (VM) running either windows or linux. The jumpbox is NIST and HIPPA compliant. A user accesses 
their jumpbox VM via VMware Horizon when connected to WSU's secure network or LAN, or connected to the network via virtual private network 
(VPN). Users can access the remainder of the CoNNECT NPC via their jumpbox.
