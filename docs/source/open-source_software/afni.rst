3.1.1.	Location
The afni package (installed from http://neuro.debian.net/pkgs/afni.html) is located at /usr/share/afni.
3.1.2.	Common Usage
AFNI is commonly utilized to overlay fMRI statistics from FSL FEAT or other output on top of T1-weighted images. Through AFNI surface mapper (SUMA), freesurfer inflated volumes can be used as the background image for the statistics, which can be viewed in 3D, as well as many other views. With certain datasets, this can provide powerful visuals.
