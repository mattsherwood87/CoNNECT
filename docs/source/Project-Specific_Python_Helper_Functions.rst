4.6.	Project-Specific Python Helper Functions
Several processing pipelines are expected to be shared across many projects with slight variations between these projects. 
These slight variations can be accounted for in simple helper functions, termed ‘project-specific functions’, which have been implemented to aid the reuse of code with minimal alterations required. The project-specific functions are placed in project-specific directories within the “project_specific_functions” folder in the python directory.  Each of these functions can be simply loaded into any python program for use.
